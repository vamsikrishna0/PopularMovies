# PopularMovies
* Android App which queries [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api)(The Movie DB) API to retrieve data about most popular movies.
* Main page lists all the movies returned by the query. Details pane for each movie which includes more details like poster, release date,  synopsis etc. An option for viewing both popular and top rated movies.

### Note: For the app to work
* Get an API Key(I used version 3) from [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup) website.
* Add the below code to your gradle.properties file.
```
MyTMDBApiKeyV3=<API Key>
```
